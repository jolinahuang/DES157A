                It was a <span class = "userInput" id = "storyAdjective"></span> night when I found the old <span class = "userInput" id = "storyNoun"></span> hidden in the attic. As soon as I touched it, I heard <span class = "userInput" id = "storyVerb"></span> noises coming from the walls. Out of nowhere, a <span class = "userInput" id = "storyCreature"></span> crawled out of the shadows, whispering my name. I tried to run, but my <span class = "userInput" id = "storyBodyPart"></span> wouldn't move! There were <span class = "userInput" id = "storyNumber"></span> glowing eyes staring at me from the dark. Desperately, I grabbed the nearest <span class = "userInput" id = "storyObject"></span> but right after that, the lights went out.
